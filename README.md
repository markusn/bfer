==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markusn/bfer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/markusn/bfer)

Brainfuck to LLVM IR compiler written in Erlang.

## Building

To build as a library to be included in another Erlang project:

```bash
rebar compile
```

To build as a standalone escript:

```bash
rebar compile escriptize
```

## Usage

When using as a library in another Erlang module the main entry point is `bfer_lib:compile/1` which
takes Brainfuck code as a string and returns LLVM IR as a string.

Used as a standalone escript `bfer` can generate native code if llvm and some kind of cc is installed:

```bash
bfer [-o] INPUT.bf OUTPUT
```

Specifying -o "optimizes" the generated LLVM IR.

## TODO
